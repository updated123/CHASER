# Agentic Chaser - 1 Minute Demo Script

## 🎯 What We Built (30 seconds)

**Agentic Chaser** is an LLM-powered autonomous system that helps UK Financial Advisors eliminate administrative burden by intelligently identifying and prioritizing what needs chasing.

### Core Problem Solved
- Advisors spend 60-70% of time on admin instead of advice
- Constant chasing of LOAs, documents, and post-advice items
- No intelligent prioritization or autonomous recommendations

### Our Solution
- **Autonomous Chasing**: Automatically identifies LOAs, documents, and post-advice items needing follow-up
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English - "What LOAs need chasing?" or "Which clients haven't had a review?"
- **Intelligent Prioritization**: Considers urgency, client value, and case importance
- **LLM-Powered**: Uses Azure OpenAI with LangGraph for semantic tool selection
